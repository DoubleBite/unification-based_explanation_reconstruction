# Unification-based Explanation Reconstruction

This is repo reproduces the paper [Unification-based Reconstruction of Multi-hop Explanations for Science Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00061). The data (`data/`, `lemmatization-en.txt`) and the evaluation code (`evaluate.py`) are taken from its original [repo](https://github.com/ai-systems/unification_reconstruction_explanations), while I rewrite the experiment flow (`experiment.py`) and the code for the knowledge bases (`lib/knowledge_base.py`) so that they can be adapted to other tasks more intuitively.
